INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS - Platformer4 Game Engine
==================================================

HOW TO PRESENT THIS PROJECT
---------------------------

1. START WITH IMPACT
   "I built a complete 2D platformer game engine from scratch - this is my 4th iteration, and I've learned a lot about architecture along the way"

2. HIGHLIGHT THE EDITOR
   "The most impressive part is the visual level editor I created - it provides a complete development environment"

3. SHOW ARCHITECTURE
   "I used a modular component-based design with clean separation of concerns. After 4 iterations, I've learned how to structure the code so that the editor and game engine work together seamlessly"

4. DEMONSTRATE TECHNICAL DEPTH
   "The physics system handles separate X/Y collision detection with proper collision response"

5. EMPHASIZE COMPLETENESS
   "It's not just a game - it's a full development framework with asset management, level editing, and multiple game systems"

QUESTIONS TO EXPECT & ANSWERS
-----------------------------

Q: "What was the most challenging part?"
A: "The most challenging part was organizing the architecture of the entire project - making the game, editor, and all systems work together cohesively. This is actually my 4th iteration of this game, and each version taught me something new about how to structure a complex project. Getting the modular design right so that the editor, game engine, and all the subsystems could communicate effectively while maintaining clean separation of concerns was the biggest technical challenge."

Q: "How did you handle the level editor?"
A: "I built a complete visual editor from scratch with real-time tile placement, multi-layer support, and JSON-based level serialization. It provides a full development environment for creating levels."

Q: "What's the architecture like?"
A: "I used a modular component-based design with clean separation of concerns. Each system (physics, rendering, AI, etc.) is self-contained but interfaces cleanly with others. After 4 iterations, I've learned how to structure the code so that the editor can seamlessly interact with the game engine, and both can share the same asset management and tilemap systems without creating tight coupling."

Q: "How did you optimize performance?"
A: "I implemented surface caching for tile rendering, efficient collision detection with spatial partitioning concepts, and optimized the rendering pipeline to maintain 60 FPS."

Q: "What would you improve?"
A: "I'd add more enemy types, implement a more sophisticated AI system, and add sound effects and music. I'd also expand the level editor with more tools and features. But honestly, after 4 iterations, I'm really happy with how the architecture turned out - the modular design makes it easy to add new features without breaking existing systems."
