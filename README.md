# üéÆ Platformer4 - Complete 2D Game Engine

![Demo](gifs/Game3.gif)

A complete 2D platformer engine built in Python using Pygame. It includes a visual level editor, modular architecture, responsive physics, AI, and rendering systems. This project demonstrates solid software design and integration of multiple systems into a single cohesive game.

## üî¨ Gameplay Systems

* Smooth player movement with gravity and velocity-based physics
* Separate X/Y collision handling for glitch-free responsiveness
* Enemy AI with edge detection, ranged attacks
* Projectile mechanics with trajectory calculation and impact detection
* Game state logic including victory/defeat, restart, and health systems

## üß±Ô∏è Level Editor & Engine Architecture

* Visual level editor with grid snapping, layer switching, and categorized hotbar
* Multi-layer tilemap engine with collision toggles
* Automatic tile variance calculation for seamless tile connections
* JSON-based save/load system for levels and configurations
* Component-based architecture with factory patterns for entity instantiation
* Dynamic asset discovery

## üñºÔ∏è Visual & Rendering Systems

* Sprite animation system with per-entity states (idle, run, jump, etc.)
* Smooth camera scrolling with easing and parallax background layers
* Particle systems with blending, physics, and mathematical distribution
* Multi-layer rendering with correct depth ordering
* Surface caching for efficient tile rendering

## üß† Technical Highlights

* Dynamic Entity-Component design for modularity and reusability
* Grid-based spatial indexing for fast lookups and optimized collision
* State machines drive animations, game logic, and UI behavior
* JSON used across levels, assets, and animation configurations
* Organized structure across core systems: editor, gameplay, rendering, UI
